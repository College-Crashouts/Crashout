# Crashout


## About The Project

Our app is a game where users have a target for a set amount of time and are trying to tag the target before time expires. We have extra features like location tracking and rule/target information in order to help people get their targets out. It provides an easier way to set up this kind of game, without having to go through the manual labor of setting up all of these features individually. This game can be played just for fun, as a fundraiser, or for competition.
